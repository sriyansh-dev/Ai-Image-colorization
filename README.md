# Ai-Image-colorization
AI Image Colorization is a deep learning–based project that automatically converts black-and-white images into realistic colored versions. It uses computer vision techniques to learn image patterns and context, enabling accurate color generation for photo restoration, enhancement, and AI image processing experiments.
